General:
- Try opening new BrowserWindow
  - Useful for storing docs and opening on button click
  - Useful for "popping out" plot containers of main window

- Add .db file to track who is using the wetbar and how many
  times they've used it.

- Display version somewhere in main window and try to add to folder
  created when packaging app

- Replace table with AG grid tables

DragDropFileContainer:
- Add get request in parent to show existing files and get rid
  of SimpleFileContainer and option to view loaded files

- Make icons smaller and color based on if file was loaded
  successfully or not

- Add delete icon that deletes loaded file from Backend

SimpleFileContainer
- Delete after updating DragDropFileContainer

Plots:
- Make paper color the background color for the div so that there's
  no white space where the collapse button is

- Add color picker for line colors

- Limit the number of items that show in the X and Y parameter
  select components with scroll

- Right now, if new data is loaded, any existing plots will not be able to access
  it. Instead of getting whatever data is loaded when a new plot is added to the page,
  add a dependency to the useEffect() to detect when new data is loaded, so all existing
  plots will have access to the data.

- Add option to normalize plots to plot container

- Add options for secondary (and more) x and y axis (include checkbox to
  enable or disable secondary axes)

- Add options for vertical and horizontal lines, shapes, annotations, etc

Backend:
- Add list option to view contents of tar file

- Add sockets to emit progress (use flask-socketio package)

- Test all parts of code that use winapi_path to make sure it works
